## Third-generation prototype focus and requirements

The third-generation device is a custom-designed circuit board with space for a microcontroller, sensors, a display, a speaker, and battery.

The goals and guidelines for this iteration are (based on brainstorming between Gunnar and Lars T):

* This is an internal project for teaching and learning about IoT, experimenting with technology and UX, and creating awareness of the space
* We also intend for the project to be a useful demo to show prospective customers
* We see this as a long-term effort where hardware, firmware, and back-end software all evolve and improve over time, as driven by the needs of the project and the needs of the people working on it
* The devices and their accompanying source code should be of reasonable quality and should be operational at all times
* There will be reasonable documentation and meaningful quickstart and how-to documents so that those that want to experiment with the devices can be up and running quickly, and can contribute meaningfully
* We'll have a feedback and project/issue tracking system that works (we're using Github)

And a non-goal:

* Unlike previous iterations, we take a limited view of how this can be productized to support actual measurements of indoor environmental factors at customer sites.  (However, other projects within Dataplattform could take that on, so long as it does not conflict with the above goals.)

## Second generation

(Lost in the mists of time, supposedly this was a 3D-printed shell for the first generation prototype)

## First generation

A microcontroller, a bunch of sensors, a breadboard, and a mass of wires, enclosed in a cardboard box.

There exists some firmware and backend functionality that was supposedly for this device, URL TBD.
