# TODO

Short term:

* Rename cli as 'snappydb'
* moto test cases - revamp
* moto test cases - test other things?
* live test cases - document, clean up
* live test cases - use assertions, not print?

Longer term:

* the CLI could have some new operations:
  * send-startup device=... would mqtt send a message, requires device credentials
  * send-observation device=... ditto
