<!-- two dropdowns, one for "device" and one for "factor", and a button, "query".
  --
  -- the two dropdowns are inactive initially and populated after fetching device
  -- names and factor names from the databases.
  --
  -- when the button is pushed with both fields populated, we fetch the data.
  --
  -- when the data arrive, we plot a time series on a canvas, ideally with some
  -- semblance of dates, at least starting and ending dates.
  --
  -- canvas can be dimensioned for "nice" laptop
  --
  -- MVP:
  --  - there should be a legend somewhere with device (or location) name
  --  - select by location rather than by device (equivalent to multiselecting device)
  --  - real server must parse device and factor
  --  - probably want to rename the lambda from snappyStartup to something else...
  --  - test with the real server by serving the html file from the lambda
  --
  -- OTHER:
  --  - better labeling
  --  - select date range
