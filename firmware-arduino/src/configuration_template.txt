# If a network is passwordless then just don't define any password values.
# There are at most three networks.  All are optional, especially if the device will
# be end-user configured later to add networks.

# Access point name (used for end-user config) is per-device since multiple devices can be active in
# the same area at the same time.  Something derived from the mqtt-id is sensible, eg, if
# mqtt-id is snp_1_1_no_48 (v1.1 device s/n 48) then using snp_1_1_no_48_cfg here is OK, note
# the name is at most 32 characters, and it's helpful to keep it <= 20, for display purposes.  Using
# "snp_" and "_cfg" makes it easy to recognize the network but is not required.
