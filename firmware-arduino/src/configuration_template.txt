# See CONFIG.md for full documentation about what it means and how it's used.

# If a network is passwordless then just don't define any password values.
# There are at most three networks.  All are optional, especially if the device will
# be end-user configured later to add networks.

# WiFi #1
set ssid1 ...FIXME...
set password1 ...FIXME...

# WiFi #2
#set ssid2 ...FIXME...
#set password2 ...FIXME...

# WiFi #3
#set ssid3 ...FIXME...
#set password3 ...FIXME...

# Sensor location ID - this is just a string, but it should be a string that is
# defined in the backend systems' database.
set location ...FIXME...

# Time service on port 8086 on this host, responds to GET /time
set time-server-host ...FIXME...

# HTTP upload service on port 8086 on this host, responds to POST /data
#set http-upload-host ...FIXME...

# Access point name (used for end-user config) is per-device since multiple devices
# can be active in the same area at the same time.  Something derived from the aws-iot-id
# is sensible, eg, if aws-iot-id is snp_1_1_no_48 (v1.1 device s/n 48) then using
# snp_1_1_no_48_config here is OK, note the name is at most 32 characters, and it's
# helpful to keep it <= 20, for display purposes.  Using "snp_" and "_config" makes it
# easy to recognize the network but is not required.

# All of the following except the class comes from AWS IoT.
# The class is "snappysense" for the SnappySense devices; TBD for other
# versions or other devices.
