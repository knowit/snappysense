config
version 1.1.0

# Normally a file like this is just pasted from the clipboard into the terminal
# when the device is in interactive configuration mode and connected to the terminal.
# The `config` command above starts the command processor; the `save` before `end`
# stores the configuration in the device.  All you need to do is reset the device afterwards.

# If a network is passwordless then just don't define any password values.
# There are at most three networks.  All are optional, especially if the device will
# be end-user configured later to add networks.

# WiFi #1
set ssid1 ...FIXME...
set password1 ...FIXME...

# WiFi #2
#set ssid2 ...FIXME...
#set password2 ...FIXME...

# WiFi #3
#set ssid3 ...FIXME...
#set password3 ...FIXME...

# Sensor location ID - this is just a string, but it should be a string that is
# defined in the backend systems' database.
set location ...FIXME...

# Time service on port 8086 on this host, responds to GET /time
set time-server-host ...FIXME...

# HTTP upload service on port 8086 on this host, responds to POST /data
set http-upload-host ...FIXME...

# Access point name is per-device (since multiple devices can be active in the same
# area at the same time).  Something derived from the aws-iot-id is sensible, eg,
# if aws-iot-id is blahblah then using snappy-blahblah-config here is probably OK,
# note the name is at most 32 characters, and it's helpful to keep it <= 20, for
# display purposes.  Using both "snappy-" and "-config" makes it easy to recognize
# the network but is not required, and abbreviations like "snp-" and "-cfg" might
# be just as good.

# All of the following except the class comes from AWS IoT.
# The class is "snappysense" for the snappysense v1.0.0 devices; TBD for other
# versions or other devices.
