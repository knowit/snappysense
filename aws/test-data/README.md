# Test data

These data were extracted from lth's sandbox DynamoDB databases using the `dump` operation of the
`dbop` program (see parent directory).  They can probably be used to seed new sandbox databases
using the `undump` operation, so long as the data format has not changed very much.

If there's any question about what the data format is, look at the data definitions in
`../dbop/dbop.go` or in `../DATA-MODEL.md` around 1 April 2023.
